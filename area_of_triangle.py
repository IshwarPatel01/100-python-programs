# first thing accept i dont know what is area of triangle
# search
# done
# i have to find how much area has taken by triangle
# mistake i rushed and didnt take time to understand what is meaning of area of triangles
# create function triangle_area
# inside have to calulate base and height and then divide with 2
# formula for calculate area of triangles is (base * height) / 2
# this operation i have to perform with declare variable calculate_area
# return result


def triangle_area(base,height):
    calculate_area = (base * height) / 2
    return calculate_area
base = 22
height = 22

result =  triangle_area(base,height)
print(result)

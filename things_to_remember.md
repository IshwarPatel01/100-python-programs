- program should be user centric
- attention to details
- edge cases
- how should be program flow so anyone can understand
- build algorithm in comments
- inside the function for result declare variable and outside of fucntion print result

- you can also do these thing write everything that comes in mind and then rearrenge in step/strucutre (create multiple like this and add to thinking box(for different senerio different thinking) eg. in different senerio different strategies)

# question to ask while writing algorithm in english
- i need any variable outside function
- i need any vairable inside function
- how many operation i have to perform


(create thinking box) -different senerio different thinking strategy

in-programming
1. implement thinking -> if ideas or implementation come to mind write it down then rearrenge (correct later or improve)
- if ideas, implementation comes to mind write it down then rearrenge
- ask how many operation i have to perform
- ask how many function we have to create
- ask how many if/else needed
- ask how many loops
- ask how many variables
- ask how many nested loop we need
- ask how many nested if/else statement we need
- ask what we need inside loop and if/else
- ask how we will perform if/else statement
- ask 




mistake i did (19/11/2024) 
- implementation 
- algorithm
- rushed (eg. mistake i rushed and didnt take time to understand what is meaning of area of triangles)
